                <strong>Stage 1 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</strong> is the earliest stage of kidney disease, where there is mild kidney damage, but the kidneys are still functioning normally.
                This stage is typically diagnosed when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is <strong>90 mL/min/1.73m² or higher</strong>, indicating that the kidneys are still effectively filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.
            </p>

            <p>However, there may be signs of kidney damage, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein in the urine (proteinuria)</li>
                <li>Abnormalities in imaging tests</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Since Stage 1 CKD often has no noticeable symptoms, it is usually detected during routine health check-ups or tests conducted for other medical conditions.
                Although the kidneys are still working well, underlying conditions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diabetes</li>
                <li>High blood pressure</li>
                <li>Genetic factors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>may contribute to the damage.</p>

            <p>Managing Stage 1 CKD involves several lifestyle changes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a balanced diet</li>
                <li>Controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels</li>
                <li>Staying hydrated</li>
                <li>Avoiding medications that can harm the kidneys (such as certain painkillers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Early intervention at this stage can significantly slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk of complications, improving long-term kidney health.
                Regular monitoring and consultations with a healthcare professional are essential to ensure kidney function remains stable and to address any potential risks.
